i've been struggling with the ssl certificate management for this site for a while now.

every time certificates expire, i have to ssh into the server, run certbot, and then remember to change the code that loads the certificates.

so i've rearchitected the whole setup. here's what changed:

1. the bun app no longer handles https directly
2. added caddy as a reverse proxy in front of the bun app
3. caddy automatically handles all the certificate stuff
4. the bun app now runs on port 3000, and caddy forwards to it

caddy automatically:

- gets certificates from let's encrypt
- configures https
- handles renewals
- redirects http to https

i've also simplified the bun app code by removing all the certificate handling stuff.

now i don't have to worry about certificate renewals at all. caddy handles it automatically in the background, and there's no code to update.

it also comes with some nice bonuses:

- http/2 support
- automatic compression
- better logging
- more secure tls defaults

the way i've set it up with docker volumes for the caddy data means that even if i restart the containers, the certificates persist. and if i ever need to upgrade caddy, i can just update the image version and restart.

it's a much more maintainable solution. no more expired certs.
